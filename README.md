# Do Graph-Level Features show how different Social Networks behave?
We are interested in understanding if the structure of a graph is closely related to its purpose and usage.
To answer the question we compared 3 Social Network graphs that have completely different usage by the public and using 
node level features, degree centrality, but mainly graph level features such as clustering coefficient, and graphlet counting.
The social networks taken in the exam are Facebook, a scrolling type of social network, Twitch, a live-streaming platform and 
GitHub, a developer collaboration platform.
The results and the conclusions are reported in the "Project Final Report".

To replicate the experiments done it's sufficient to download the database for Facebook, Twitch, and GitHub from above, and singularly
use the codes reported above. Some programs don't need modifications others require a file txt or a a path from to the list 
of edges of the database. In any case, in each program is specified if and which additions are needed.
