# Do Graph-Level Features show how different Social Networks behave?
We are interested in understanding if the structure of a graph is closely related to its purpose and usage.
To answer the question we compared 3 Social Network graphs that have completely different usage by the public and using 
node level features,degree centrality, but mainly graph level features as clustering coefficient, and graphlet counting.
The social networks taken in exam are Facebook, a scrolling type of social network, Twitch, a live-streaming platform and 
GitHub, a developer collaboration platform.
